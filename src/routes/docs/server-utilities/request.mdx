# Request

## Overview

The `Request` struct represents the HTTP request.
It is passed as the first argument to every server side handler (for both route and API).

```rs
use tuono_lib::{Request, Response};

#[tuono_lib::handler]
async fn my_route_handler(req: Request) -> Response {
  // ...
}
```

> The `Request` argument is required and must always be defined.

## Fields

The struct has the following three public fields:

```rs
pub struct Request {
  pub uri: Uri,
  pub headers: HeaderMap,
  pub params: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

> The `Request` struct contains all the data needed to manage a request.
> We will soon implement a set of methods to simplify interaction with
> the request body, cookies, and more.

### `uri`

The `uri` param represents the current request URI.
It is a [http crate URI](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/uri/struct.Uri.html)
so all its methods are available.

### `headers`

All the headers passed with the request are available in this included Headers, Cookies and Body.
It is a [http crate HeaderMap](https://docs.rs/http/1.2.0/http/header/struct.HeaderMap.html)
so all its methods are available.

### `params`

Within the `params` [HashMap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/hash_map/struct.HashMap.html)
you can find the parameters passed in the dynamic paths.

For example, if we want to read the `userId` parameter in the following project structure:

```text
├── src
│   └── routes
│       └── [userId]/index.rs
```

We just have to read the `userId` key in the `params` HashMap.

```rs
// src/routes/[userId]/index.rs
use tuono_lib::{Request, Response};

#[tuono_lib::handler]
async fn my_route_handler(req: Request) -> Response {
  let user_id = req.params.get("userId").unwrap();
  // ...
}
```

The same syntax applies also for catch-all dynamic path (i.e. `[...userId]`).

## Methods

### `body`

The `body` method provides a safe way to read and parse the body of an HTTP request.

Here's an example of using the `body` method to retrieve data from a `POST` request.

```rs
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct MyBody {
   pub field: u8
}

#[tuono_lib::api(POST)]
async fn my_post_request(req: Request) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let body: MyBody = req.body().unwrap();
}
```

> Keep in mind that specifying the type is essential, as the method relies on it to determine the appropriate body serialization.

### `form_data`

The `form_data` method allows you to parse form data from requests with the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

Here's an example of using the `form_data` method to handle data from a form submission:

```rs
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct ContactForm {
   pub name: String,
   pub email: String,
   pub message: String
}

#[tuono_lib::api(POST)]
async fn contact_handler(req: Request) -> impl IntoResponse {
    match req.form_data::<ContactForm>() {
        Ok(form) => {
            // Process the contact form data
            // Return a success response
            StatusCode::OK.into_response()
        },
        Err(err) => {
            // FormError implements IntoResponse and will automatically:
            // - Return 415 UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE for InvalidContentType
            // - Return 400 BAD_REQUEST for ParseError
            // - Return 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR for ServerError
            // - Include a JSON error message in the response body
            err.into_response()
        }
    }
}
```

This method returns a `Result<T, FormError>` where:

- `FormError::InvalidContentType` - Returned when the content-type is not `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `FormError::ParseError` - Returned when there's an error parsing the form data
- `FormError::ServerError` - Returned when a server-side error occurs

`FormError` implements `IntoResponse` for convenient error handling in API routes.

> Keep in mind that specifying the type is essential, as the method relies on it to determine the appropriate body serialization.
