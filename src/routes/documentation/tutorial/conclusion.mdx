# Conclusion

## What a tutorial :)

Thatâ€™s it! You just created a multi thread full stack application with Rust and React.

The project is still under heavy development and many features are not ready yet, but
I hope you got the taste of what is like working with rust and react in the same stack.

As I mentioned in the introduction, I'd love to hear what you thought about the
framework and the tutorial - feel free to join the [official discord server](https://discord.com/invite/khQzPa654B)
or to reach me on Twitter (X) [@valerioageno](https://twitter.com/valerioageno).

Ciao
