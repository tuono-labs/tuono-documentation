# Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial is meant to give you a sneak peek at the framework and is intended to evolve during the
development - be sure to have [installed](/documentation/getting-started/installation) the [latest version](https://crates.io/crates/tuono).

This tutorial is not meant for people who don't know React - in that case, I suggest you first read the
[React Doc](https://react.dev/); Typescript and Rust knowledge is not a requirement though!

If you prefer to just read the code rather than write you can download the finished tutorial project with:

```sh
tuono new tutorial --template tuono-tutorial
```
