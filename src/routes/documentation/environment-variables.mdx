# Environment Variables

## Overview

Tuono supports environment variables on both client and server, providing hot reload in both scenarios.

- Loads from `.env.*` files
- Manages precedence across multiple env files
- Supports hot reload on both client and server
- Bundles client env vars with the `TUONO_PUBLIC_` prefix

## Usage

Define your environment variables in `.env` file(s). Here we will use a `.env` and a `.env.local`.

```
# .env
foo
```

```
# .env.local

```

Here, variables set in `.env.local` will override variables set in `.env`. We cover this in more detail in the [precedence section](#precedence).

### Clientside



### Serverside

Environment variables are automatically loaded into the rust environment, allowing you to use them just like you would use a system environment variable in any other rust codebase.

```rs
use std::env;
use tuono_lib::Request;
use tuono_lib::axum::http::StatusCode;

#[tuono_lib::api(GET)]
pub async fn health_check(_req: Request) -> StatusCode {
    println!("{}", env::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("DATABASE_URL not set"));
    StatusCode::OK
}
```

## File Types and Precedence

System environment variables take priority, and are never overridden. After that, precedence works in order of specificity, with the most specific env file taking priority.

```text
.env                # loaded in all cases
.env.local          # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]         # only loaded in specified mode
.env.[mode].local   # only loaded in specified mode, ignored by git
```


## Caveats, Gotchas and Notes

- Secrets should only be stored in `*.local` files, as those are the only files ignored by git.
- When you create a new env file, it is not automatically loaded. You will have to restart the server to achieve this.
