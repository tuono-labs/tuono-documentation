# Request

## Overview

The `Request` struct represents the HTTP request.
It is passed as the first argument to every server side handler (for both route and API).

```rs
use tuono_lib::{Request, Response};

#[tuono_lib::handler]
async fn my_route_handler(req: Request) -> Response {
  // ...
}
```

> The `Request` argument is required and must always be defined.

The struct has the following three public fields:

```rs
pub struct Request {
  pub uri: Uri,
  pub headers: HeaderMap,
  pub params: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

> The `Request` struct contains all the data needed to manage a request.
> We will soon implement a set of methods to simplify interaction with
> the request body, cookies, and more.

### `uri`

The `uri` param represents the current request URI.
It is a [http crate URI](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/uri/struct.Uri.html)
so all its methods are available.

### `headers`

All the headers passed with the request are available in this included Headers, Cookies and Body.
It is a [http crate HeaderMap](https://docs.rs/http/1.2.0/http/header/struct.HeaderMap.html)
so all its methods are available.

### `params`

Within the `params` [HashMap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/hash_map/struct.HashMap.html)
you can find the parameters passed in the dynamic paths.

For example, if we want to read the `userId` parameter in the following project structure:

```text
├── src
│   └── routes
│       └── [userId]/index.rs
```

We just have to read the `userId` key in the `params` HashMap.

```rs
// src/routes/[userId]/index.rs
use tuono_lib::{Request, Response};

#[tuono_lib::handler]
async fn my_route_handler(req: Request) -> Response {
  let user_id = req.params.get("userId").unwrap();
  // ...
}
```

The same syntax applies also for catch-all dynamic path (i.e. `[...userId]`).
