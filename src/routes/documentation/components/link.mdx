# Link

## Overview

Tuono provides a `Link` component for clientside navigation between pages of your app. `Link` prefetches pages from any links above the fold, allowing for faster navigations without a full reload.

```tsx
import { Link } from 'tuono'

export default function Page() {
  return <Link href="/page2">My Other Page</Link>
}
```

For navigating to pages outside of your app (other websites), you should use the `<a>` tag.

> Additional considerations:
>
> - Any `Link` in the viewport is prefetched by default when it appears within the viewport.
> - The corresponding data for server-rendered routes is fetched only when the `Link` is clicked.

## Reference

The `Link` component behaves similarly to the `<a>` HTML tag, with a few additional features controlled by the following props:

| Prop      | Type                | Default value | Description                                                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `href`    | `string` (Required) | -             | Relative path to the page in your application. Anchor names (links with hashtags) are also valid. |
| `preload` | `boolean`           | `true`        | Whether to preload the page if the link is within the viewport.                                   |
| `scroll`  | `boolean`           | `true`        | Whether to preserve scroll position between navigations.                                          |
