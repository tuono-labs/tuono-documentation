# Local development

Thanks for your interest! In this page, you find the instructions to set up `tuono` on your local environment!

## Setup

### Fork and clone repository

After [forking the repo on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-name-here>/tuono
cd tuono
```

For the next steps, you can either set up the environment directly on your computer or use a ready-to-use Docker image (go to the [Docker setup](#docker-setup) part).

### Local setup

#### Rust tool chain

Install the Rust programming language tool chain (`rust` and `cargo`).
Follows instructions in the official [docs](https://rustup.rs/)

#### Node.js â€” runtime

Install `Node.js`.
You can follow the instructions from the [Node official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

> ðŸ’¡ This project has a `.nvmrc` file to specify the node version used in development.
>
> Consider to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) so you can run
>
> ```sh
> nvm use
> ```
>
> to simply pick up the correct version!

#### Node.js â€” package manager

We use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) as Node.js package manager.

You can see which version of yarn we use by checking the `packageManager` field in the root `package.json`.

#### Pre-flight checks

To check that everything is working properly, run:

```sh
pnpm run check-all
cargo build
```

### Docker setup

#### Introduction

Docker takes care of configuring the development environment, so you donâ€™t need to worry about installing specific versions of packages like Node.js or pnpm. The Docker image handles this for you!
Using Docker, **the only operations youâ€™ll need to manage on your host machine are related to git**. (don't use pnpm, cargo, ... from your host machine)
Some IDEs (such as vscode with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)) allow you to connect directly to the Docker container.

**Before proceeding with this guide, make sure that the `node_modules` and `target` directories are either absent or empty in the subprojects of Tuono from your host machine where you want to contribute.**
This ensures a clean and consistent environment when using Docker.

#### Build the Tuono's Docker Container

First, ensure Docker is installed on your machine by following the instructions on the [Docker official site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Once Docker is installed, use the following command to build the image into a container named tuono-source-container:

```sh
# Note: Execute this command in the project root
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up --build -d
```

To verify that everything is working as expected, run the following command:

```sh
docker images && docker ps -a --size
```

Or on Windows:

```powershell
docker images; docker ps -a --size
```

You should see the image named tuono-source-image and the container tuono-source-container. The container's status should be "up".

Use the following command to connect to the container:

```sh
docker exec -it tuono-source-container /bin/bash
```

## Tuono development

1. Start tuono frontend build using

   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```

2. In another terminal run

   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

   To automatically rebuild crates on code change, consider using `cargo-watch` crate

   ```sh
   cargo watch -x build -w crates/
   ```

3. You can now use the binary inside `/target/debug/tuono` in another folder on your local machine

   > Consider adding an alias to your shell setup file
   >
   > ```sh
   > alias t="/path-to-repo/target/debug/tuono"
   > ```

## Documentation development

1. Change the current working directory to the documentation folder:

   ```sh
   cd apps/documentation
   ```

2. Run

   ```sh
   tuono dev
   ```

3. Open the localhost URL.

> On the documentation remember that `tuono` `npm` package is installed from the registry and
> it is not linked to the repository.

## Validate your changes

The following checks are all run on pull requests automatically.

You can also perform them locally.

## Formatting

For the typescript part you can run:

```sh
pnpm run format:check && pnpm run -w repo:root:format:check
```

For the rust codebase run:

```sh
cargo fmt
```

### Linting

For the typescript part you can run:

```sh
pnpm run lint
```

For the rust codebase run:

```sh
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

### Tests

For the typescript part you can run:

```sh
pnpm run test
```

For the rust codebase run:

```sh
cargo test
```
