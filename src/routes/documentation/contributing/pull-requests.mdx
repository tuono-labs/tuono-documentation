# Pull Requests

## Overview

Once your changes are ready, you can create a PR!

If you are not familiar with GitHub pull requests,
you can check the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

---

- Please do:

  - Fill the template in full

    - If you are fixing an issue, bear in mind to link the issue itself in the PR description.
    - If you are adding a new feature, describe the intended use case that the feature fulfills.

  - Ensure your code is valid by running the test on you local machine.
    Refer to ["Validate your changes" section](/documentation/contributing/local-development)

- Please **don't**:

  - Do not use force push after marking the PR ready for review.

    **Reasoning:** GitHub cannot track changes across force pushes,
    which slows down our ability to perform incremental reviews.

## Title

The PR title must match the following format:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <short description>
```

You can find commit examples in the [recent commits on main branch](https://github.com/tuono-labs/tuono/commits/main/)

Here are some examples:

- feat: add support for react 19
- ci: create install-node-dependencies action
- feat(packages/tuono-router): use React.Context to pass data
- test(packages/tuono): messageChannel - use vi.fn

> We do not care about the number, or style of commits in your branch history,
> because we squash merge every PR into `main`.
>
> Feel free to commit in whatever style you feel comfortable with.

### type

Must be one of the following

{/* @warning Keep in sync with .github/workflows/pr-title-checker.yml */}

- `docs` - if you only change documentation, and not shipped code
- `feat` - any new functionality additions
- `fix` - any bug fixes that don't add new functionality
- `refactor` - a code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
- `test` - if you only change tests, and not shipped code
- `ci` - if you change something related to continuos integration
- `chore` - anything else (e.g.: release)

### optional scope

A scope may be provided to a commit's type,
to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis
E.g.: `fix(crates/tuono): remove cargo warnings`

### short description

A succinct title for the PR.
(The title max length is set to 100 characters)

## Addressing review feedback

Once we've reviewed your PR, we’ll provide feedback on any changes that need attention.
If you feel a suggested change isn’t correct, feel free to discuss it with us in the comments.

Please [post your comments](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-comments-to-a-pull-request)
as line comments when possible so they can be threaded.

After addressing all feedback, whether through code changes or by starting a follow-up discussion,
please [re-request a review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#re-requesting-a-review)
from each maintainer whose feedback you've addressed.
