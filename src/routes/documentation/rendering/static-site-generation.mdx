# Static Site Generation

## Overview

> ðŸš§ This feature is experimental and still misses few case scenarios. It will be stabilized soon.

Tuono is a progressive framework that meets all development needs,
from building simple apps without server capabilities to creating fully server side rendered applications with dynamic data.

If a page uses Static Generation, its HTML is generated at build time and reused on each request.
It can also be cached by a CDN.

In Tuono, you can statically generate pages with or without data.

> For the current development stage the whole app has to opt for SSG or SSR. Mixed rendering strategies are not available yet.

## Usage

To build a project statically just run:

```sh
tuono build â€”-static
```

This command builds all the JS and CSS assets, and also pre-renders each page into its own separate `index.html` file.

You can still use `#[tuono_lib::handler]` to load remote data,
but it will only be loaded at build time.
