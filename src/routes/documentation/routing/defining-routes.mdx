# Pages and layouts

## Overview

Tuono has a file-system based router built on the concept of routes.

When a file is added to the `src/routes` directory, it's automatically available as a route.

In Tuono, a page is a [React Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) exported from a `.tsx` file in the `src/routes` directory.
Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

Every page is rendered server side by default.

Example:
If you create `src/routes/about.tsx` that exports a React component like:

```tsx
export default function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}
```

The `About` component will be rendered when loading `/about` route.

## Index routes

The router will automatically route files named `index` to the root of the directory.

- `src/routes/index.tsx` → `/`
- `src/routes/blog/index.tsx`→ `/blog`

## Nested routes

You can also create a nested folder structure, and files will still be routed in the same way.

- `src/routes/blog/first-post.tsx` → `/blog/first-post`
- `src/routes/dashboard/settings/username.tsx` → `/dashboard/settings/username`

## Pages with Dynamic Routes

Tuono supports pages with dynamic routes segments.
For example, if you create a file called `src/routes/posts/[id].tsx`,
then it will be accessible at `posts/1`, `posts/2`, etc.

## The Root route (Layout components)

Tuono allows you to have a layout component to wrap all the routes included within the same folder.
To define such component you will have to create a `__layout.tsx` file (is allowed only a single `__layout` file per folder).

This file won't generate any route.

### Layout component for all routes

`src/routes/__layout.tsx` is a required file that defines the layout component that wraps the entire application.

```tsx
// src/routes/__layout.tsx
import { TuonoScripts } from 'tuono'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <TuonoScripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

> ⚠️ This component is **not** optional and must include:
>
> - `<html>` and `<body>` HTML tags
> - `<TuonoScripts />` component.

### Layout component for specific routes

A file created in this location will wrap only the routes defined within the `src/routes/posts` folder.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/__layout.tsx
export default function PostLayout({ children }) {
  return <article>{children}</article>
}
```

Referring to the two examples above consider that:

- `/posts/examples-post` → will be wrapped by:

```tsx
<RootLayout>
  <PostLayout>
    <ExamplePost />
  </PostLayout>
</RootLayout>
```

- `/about` → will be wrapped by:

```tsx
<RootLayout>
  <About />
</RootLayout>
```
