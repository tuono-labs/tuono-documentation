# Installation

## Requirements

Tuono is a development environment built with Rust and TypeScript that generates a website using both languages.
To work with Tuono, you'll need to have the following tools installed on your computer:

- `Rust` - The Rust programming language tool chain (Go [here](https://rustup.rs/) for installing both `rust` and `cargo`)
- `Cargo` - The rust package manager
- `NodeJs` - The JavaScript runtime (Go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for installing both `nodejs` and `npm`)
- `npm` or `yarn` or `pnpm` - A javaScript package manager

> Node.js is only required for the development environment; the final output runs on a Rust server.

## How to install

The tuono `CLI` is hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tuono) to download and install it, just run it on a terminal:

```sh
cargo install tuono
```

To check that it is correctly installed, run:

```sh
tuono --version
```

Run `tuono -h` to see all the available commands.
