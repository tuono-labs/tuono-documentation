# Setup project

## Create project folder

Tuono supports creating a new project from scratch using the `tuono new` CLI command.

```sh
tuono new my-first-tuono-app
```

> 💡 You can optionally pass the --template (or -t) flag to directly start from a [template](https://github.com/tuono-labs/tuono/tree/main/examples)

Once the `tuono new` command finishes, move into the newly created folder.

```sh
cd my-first-tuono-app
```

## Install dependencies

Now you can install the required dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

> 💡 You can use another NodeJS package manager like `yarn` or `pnpm`

## Run dev server

Now you can run the dev server for the first time from using:

```sh
tuono dev
```

> ⏰ The first time, the process takes a bit longer to start because it needs to compile all of Rust's dependencies.
> Subsequent executions will be much quicker!

Once it's ready, a message will be displayed in the terminal.

You can now open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000) on the browser.

## Build and test production build

To build the project using production mode, simply run:

```sh
tuono build
```

The above command has created the final assets in the `out` directory.

To run the production server, run:

```sh
cargo run --release
```

Again, you can access the website in production mode
by going to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
