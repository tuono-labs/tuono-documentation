# TypeScript

## Overview

In Tuono, TypeScript is a first-class citizen.

The `tuono` package is entirely written in TypeScript, allowing developers to leverage strong type checking to ensure program correctness when interacting with `tuono` functions and modules.

## Automatic Type Generation

Typically, types need to be defined twice: first in the Rust handlers and then in the React components/routes to consume the backend payload.

Duplicating the same interfaces is error-prone and can lead to production bugs.

To simplify development, `tuono` enables automatic TypeScript type generation for all `structs` and `enums` defined in any Rust file.

### The `Type` Trait

Any struct or enum can be `derived` with the `Type` trait, and the corresponding TypeScript interface will be automatically generated on the frontend.

For example, the following struct declaration:

```rust
use tuono_lib::Type;

#[derive(Type)]
struct User {
  id: String,
  email: String,
  age: u8,
  cart: Vec<Item>,
  saved: HashMap<String, Item>
}
```

Will be available in any TypeScript file as:

```typescript
import type { User } from 'tuono/types'
```

The generated type will be mapped as:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
  age: number
  cart: Item[]
  saved: Record<string, Item>
}
```

### Serde Support

To pass the payload to React, the data must be deserialized, and [serde](https://serde.rs/) is the default serializer/deserializer crate supported by `tuono`.

`tuono` supports all of serde's modifiers, ensuring that the generated TypeScript type matches the payload passed to the frontend.

```rust
use tuono_lib::Type;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Type, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct Cart {
  id: String,
  items: Vec<Item>,
  saved_items: HashMap<String, Item>,
  #[serde(rename = "total_amount")]
  cart_total_amount: String,
  #[serde(skip)]
  secret_thing: String
}
```

Note: Manually serialized elements cannot be automatically generated.

> This feature is strongly inspired by the [ts_rs](https://docs.rs/ts-rs/latest/ts-rs/) crate.
