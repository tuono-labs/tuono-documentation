# API fetching

In this tutorial, we will fetch a list of all first generation Pokémon (the best ones, by the way) from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) and create a dynamic page for each of them.

## Fetch all the Pokémon

Let's start by fetching the data on the root page.
Since we want to render the Pokémon on the server, we need to implement the logic in the `index.rs` file.

Clear the `index.rs` file and paste:

```rs
// src/routes/index.rs
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use reqwest::Client;
use tuono_lib::{Props, Request, Response};

const ALL_POKEMON: &str = "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151";

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Pokemons {
    results: Vec<Pokemon>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Pokemon {
    name: String,
    url: String,
}

#[tuono_lib::handler]
async fn get_all_pokemons(_req: Request, fetch: Client) -> Response {
    return match fetch.get(ALL_POKEMON).send().await {
        Ok(res) => {
            let data = res.json::<Pokemons>().await.unwrap();
            Response::Props(Props::new(data))
        }
        Err(_err) => Response::Props(Props::new("{}")),
    };
}
```

> The first argument is always `req: Request`, which contains all the request data, such as the query parameters and HTTP headers.
> The other arguments represent the [ApplicationState](/documentation/application-state) and are optional.

After doing this, the terminal will complain for two reasons:

1. We haven't imported the `reqwest` crate
2. The second argument `fetch: Client` hasn't been defined as global state yet.

Let's fix these errors in the next section.

## Application state

Compared to JavaScript runtimes, Tuono is lightning fast because it only loads the features that you need for your project.

You can load them in the `ApplicationState` inside the `./src/app.rs` file. This file is executed just once at the very beginning of your application.

> For the tutorial we will use [Reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/), which is one of the most popular HTTP libraries.

To install it, run this command in your terminal:

```sh
cargo add reqwest
```

A new entry was added to your `Cargo.toml` file.

```diff
[package]
name = "tuono"
version = "0.0.1"
edition = "2021"

[[bin]]
name = "tuono"
path = ".tuono/main.rs"

[dependencies]
tuono_lib = "0.14.0" # the version might be different
serde = { version = "1.0.202", features = ["derive"] }
++ reqwest = "0.12.9" # the version might be different
```

> The `Cargo.toml` file is the manifest of your application and contains Rust's dependencies
> (similar to the `package.json` file for JavaScript).

Now let's define the `ApplicationState` in the `./src/app.rs` file.

```rs
// Import the reqwest library
use reqwest::Client;

#[derive(Clone)]
// Extend this struct with the feature you will need for your application
pub struct ApplicationState {
    // This will be available to all your route handlers
    pub fetch: Client,
}

pub fn main() -> ApplicationState {
    let fetch = Client::new();
    return ApplicationState { fetch };
}
```

Now that the `fetch: Client` argument is available in the handler, the previously reported errors should be resolved.
In the next section, we'll render the fetched data in the browser.

## Handling the page UI

With the Pokémon correctly fetched and hydrated on the client, we can finally render them.
Replace the content of the `index.tsx` file with the following snippet:

```tsx
// src/routes/index.tsx
import type { JSX } from 'react'
import type { TuonoRouteProps } from 'tuono'

interface IndexProps {
  results: Array<{ name: string; url: string }>
}

export default function IndexPage({
  data,
}: TuonoRouteProps<IndexProps>): JSX.Element | null {
  if (!data?.results) return null

  return (
    <>
      <header className="header">
        <a
          href="https://crates.io/crates/tuono"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Crates
        </a>
        <a
          href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tuono"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Npm
        </a>
      </header>
      <div className="title-wrap">
        <h1 className="title">
          TU<span>O</span>NO
        </h1>
        <div className="logo">
          <img src="rust.svg" className="rust" />
          <img src="react.svg" className="react" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <ul style={{ flexWrap: 'wrap', display: 'flex', gap: 10 }}>
        {data.results.map((pokemon) => (
          <li key={pokemon.name} style={{ marginLeft: '16px' }}>
            {pokemon.name}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

Time to refresh the browser! It's still a bit ugly, but all the Pokémon are finally on the screen!
